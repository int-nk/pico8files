# Pool Physics

I was playing the Yakuza games and felt inspired to try to make pool, or at least to simulate the physics. Learning how to make the balls react with each other was pretty fun to learn about. Currently this code works well with two balls, I still need to work out how to better simulate it with more than two balls.
